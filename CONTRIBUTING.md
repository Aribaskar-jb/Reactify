<br>

## Step 1: Fork the Reactify project repository.

You'll need to have a copy of the Reactify project repository to make your own contributions, so go ahead and fork it into your list of repositories.

Remeber to install all the required dependencies for the project before making your contributions. The branch will need two of those dependencies to help you make a clean contribution.

1. Prettier - To help with formatting your entries.
2. Husky - To run prettier before your commit is passed.

Simply run the following command in the root of your forked Reactify project to have all the dependencies installed.

```
pnpm install
```

> The Reactify project uses PNPM as package manager instead of NPM - PNPM is a more performant version of NPM. Migrating to PNPM from NPM can take you only as little as 5 minutes. You simply install PNPM using NPM, then you replace "npm" with "pnpm" in your subsequent commands - it's that easy. Please [checkout the PNPM website](https://pnpm.io/) to learn more about it.

## Step 2: Make your contribution.

Reactify is awesome project that provides contributors with different options to contribute.
Please read the [the Project announcement article](https://zhacks.hashnode.dev/finish-celebrating-hacktoberfest-2022-by-contributing-to-reactify) to learn about the different ways you can contribute to the project. Once you are sure about the contribution(s) you wish to make, you can then go ahead with it. You can also check the list of available issues, you can start from there.

## Step 3: Preview your contribution, and Create a pull request.

After making your contribution, the next step will be to create a pull request. Every pull request you make before the end of October, will count as an important participation in Hacktober first 2022 - and every succesfully merged pull request will mean a lot for you. So after making your contribution, do not hesitate to create you pull request. Remember that you'll need 4 succesfully merged ones to make it through Hacktoberfest 2022.

> Once your PR is created, be rest assured that a maintainer will be right on the other side to see to it getting reviewed and merged as fast as possible.
